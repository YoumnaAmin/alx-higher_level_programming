This library is very simple, since it only has one function called
``say_my_name()``.

=======

``say_my_name`` prints the first_name and the last_name of a person and it shoukd be a string

::

    >>> say_my_name = __import__('3-say_my_name').say_my_name
    >>> say_my_name(12, "White")
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: first_name must be a string
    
    >>> say_my_name("black", 12)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: last_name must be a string


Non-Numbers

    >>> say_my_name("John", "Smith")
    My name is John Smith

    >>> say_my_name("Walter", "White")
